    # NOTES:
    #   - `pipefail` must be enabled in order to get the exit code from the conda-recipe-manager commands when
    #     the output is piped into `tee`
    #   - We setup empty environment variables like `PREFIX` to suppress rattler-build dry-run failures that are
    #     specific to the expected build environment. Such a failure does not reflect our ability to convert recipe
    #     files successfully. We should remove these environment changes if/when rattler-build gives us another way to
    #     validate recipe files.
